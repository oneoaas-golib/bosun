## Changes Since 0.5.0
This configuration has been split into two different files. This page documents the various bosun sections thats can be defined. For example alerts, templates, notifications, macros, global variables, and lookups.

## Definition Configuration File
All definitions are in a single file that is pointed to in the system configuration (TODO: Make link here to that def). The file is UTF-8 encoded.

### Syntax
Syntax is sectional, with each section having a type and a name, followed by `{` and ending with `}`. Each section is a definition (for example, and alert definition or a notification definition. Key/value pairs follow of the form `key = value`. Key names are non-whitespace characters before the `=`. The value goes until end of line and is a string. Multi-line strings are supported using backticks to delimit start and end of string. Comments go from a `#` to end of line (unless the `#` appears in a backtick string). Whitespace is trimmed at ends of values and keys.

## Alert Definitions
An alert is defined with the following syntax:

```
alert uniqueAlertName {
    variable = value
    ...
    keyword = value
    ...
}
```

The minimum requirement for an alert is that it have a `warn` or `crit` expresion. However, the most common case is to define at least: `warn`, `warnNotification`, `crit`, `critNotification`, and `template`.

### Alert Keywords

#### warn
The expression to evaluate to set a warn state for an incident that is instantiated from the alert definition. 

The expression must evaluate to a NumberSet or a Scalar. 0 is false (do not trigger) and any non-zero value is true (will trigger). 

If the crit expression is true, the warn expression will not be evaluated as crit supersedes warn.

No warn notifications will be sent if `warnNotification` is not declared in the alert definition. It will still however appear on the dashboard.

#### crit
The expression to evaluate to set a critical state for an incident that is instantiated from the alert definition.

As with warn, the expression must return a Scalar or NumberSet. 

No crit notifications will be sent if `critNotification` is not declared in the alert definition. It will still appear on the dashboard.

#### critNotification
Comma-separated list of notifications to trigger on critical a state (when the crit expression is non-zero). This line may appear multiple times and duplicate notifications, which will be merged so only one of each notification is triggered. Lookup tables may be used when `lookup("table", "key")` is an entire `critNotification` value. See example below.

#### warnNotification
Identical to critNotification (TODO: Link to above), but for warning states.

#### template
The name of the template that will be used to send alerts to the specified notifications for the alert.

#### runEvery
Multiple of global system configuration value `checkFrequency` at which to run this alert. If unspecified, the global system configuration value `defaultRunEvery` will be used.

#### squelch
Squelch (TODO Link to squelch detail) is comma-separated list of `tagk=tagv` pairs. `tagv` is a regex. If the current tag group matches all values, the alert is squelched, and will not trigger as crit or warn. For example, `squelch = host=ny-web.*,tier=prod` will match any group that has at least that host and tier. Note that the group may have other tags assigned to it, but since all elements of the squelch list were met, it is considered a match. Multiple squelch lines may appear; a tag group matches if any of the squelch lines match.

This can also be defined at the global of level of the configuration. 

When using squelch, alerts will be removed even if they are not with-in the scope of the final tagset. The common case of this would be using the `t` (tranpose function) to reduce the number of final results. So when doing this, results will still be remove because they are removed at the expression level for the `warn` and `crit` expressions.

#### unknown
unknown is the time at which to mark an incident unknown (TODO: Link to details of unknown) if it can not be evaluated. It defaults the system configuration global variable `checkFrequency`.

#### ignoreUnknown
Setting `ignoreUnknown = true`, will prevent an alert from becoming unknown. This is often used where you expect the tagsets or data for an alert to be sparse and/or you want to ignore things that stop sending information. 

#### unknownIsNormal
Setting `unknownIsNormal = true` will convert unknown events for an incident into a normal event.

This is often useful if you are alerting on log messages where the absence of log messages means that the state should go back to normal. Using `ignoreUnknown` with this setting would be unnecessary.

#### unjoinedOk
If present, will ignore unjoined expression errors. Unjoins happen when expressions with in an alert use a comparison operator, and there are tagsets in one set but are not in the other set.

#### log
Setting `log = true` will make the alert behave as a "log alert". It will never show up on the dashboard, but will execute notifications every check interval where the status is abnormal.

#### maxLogFrequency
Setting `maxLogFrequency = true` will throttle log notifications to the specified duration. `maxLogFrequency = 5m` will ensure that notifications only fire once every 5 minutes for any given alert key. Only valid on alerts that have `log = true`.

## Variables
Variables are in the form of `$foo = someText` where someText continues until the end of the line. These are not variables in the sense that they hold a value, rather they are simply text replacement done by the the parsers.

## Global Variables

## Templates 

## Notifications

## Lookups
